1. Understanding a Multi-Agent System (MAS)</summary>


- agent: entities that can reason, act, communicate and adapt to solve problems
- A multi-agent system: group of agents collaborating to solve tasks, each agent has their own abilities (reasoning, acting, communicating, adapting)
- multi agent system has two core components which can be driven by a combination of generative AI models, tools, and human input:
  - agent capabilities: method by which agents address tasks
    - mechanisms for reasoning (planning, deducing, etc. by applying some rules or logic), reasoning can be deductive, inductive, abductive
    - mechanisms for acting (utilizing tools)
    - mechanisms for adapting (learning, recalling information from memory), adjust their actions, and plans based on changing conditions, new information, or feedback from other agents and humans
  - agent interactions: how agents communicate and collaborate to solve tasks
    -  agent workflows (how agents are organized or grouped to address tasks)
    -  agent orchestration (the sequence in which agents take action as the task progresses)
- multiple agents suit for complex tasks, task requiring Planning, Diverse Expertise, Extensive Context, Adaptive Solutions
