  <br>
Agentic workflow that LangChain support via LangGraph (a cyclical graph define agents and their brhaviors)


- ReAct: Reasoning and action
- SELF-REFINE: iterative refinement that we were talking about
- AlphaCodium: alpha coing creating coding agent using flow engineering

Persistence and Streaming
</summary>
<br>
This topics is about two additional capability that are helpful when building agents
  
- Human input: this allows you to guide an agent at critical points
- Persistence: the ability to store the current state of information so that we can return to it later, which great for debugging an agent and productionalizing them
